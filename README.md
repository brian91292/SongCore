# SongCore
A plugin for handling custom song additions in Beat Saber.
## Configuration
- The Settings for SongCore can be found in the `UserData/SongCore` Folder, or in game in the Mod Settings section of the main menu
## Installing Custom Songs
- Custom Song folders go in `Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels`
- The song files must be in the root of the song folder, and not within a subfolder
- You can place songs in the `Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels` folder instead to place them in the `WIP Maps` song pack and have them only be playable in practice mode. This is recommended if you are either making the map yourself or testing someone else's map
### Zip Files
- You can place Zip files in `Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels` and whenever SongCore Loads songs it will attempt to handle them in the following way
- Clearing the `Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels/Cache` folder of all files
- Extracting the zips to the Cache folder inside of a folder of the same name of the zip
- Attempting to load any songs found within the Cache folder
- If any songs are successfully loaded from the Cache folder, they will show up within a "Cached WIP Maps" LevelPack next to the WIP Maps pack
- This loading is less efficient due to having to extract the zips every time, and occurs before regular loading starts, so be aware that song loading may slow down if you have a large amount of zips in the folder
### Additional Song Folders
- You can specify additional folders to load songs from by modifying the `UserData/SongCore/folders.xml` file, which is generated by SongCore when loading the game if it does not exist
- Example File:
```xml
<!--  
		Syntax for folder entries	(Entries with name Example will be skipped)
		<folder>
		<Name> Name to be used for the folder entry, is used for level pack name if set to be a new pack i.e. SecondSongFolder </Name>
		<Path> Full path to the folder to be used i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\SecondSongFolder </Path>
		<Pack> either 0, 1, or 2. 0 means the songs will be put in the main custom levels pack, 1 means it will be put in the wip levels pack, and 2 means it will be put into a new pack </Pack>
		<ImagePath> If Pack is 2, will attempt to load this image to use as the pack cover. Use the Full Path to the Image </ImagePath>
		<WIP> If Pack is 2, songs in this folder will be treated as WIP and only be playable in practice mode. Use True/False for the value </WIP>

		</folder>
		
		Example Entry:
		<folder>
			<Name>SecondSongFolder</Name>
			<Path>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\SecondSongFolder</Path>
			<Pack>2</Pack>
			<WIP>True</WIP>
		</folder>
-->
<folders>
  <folder>
    <Name>Example</Name>
    <Path>ExamplePath</Path>
    <Pack>0</Pack>
    <WIP>False</WIP>
    <ImagePath>Example</ImagePath>
  </folder>
  <folder>
    <Name>Example</Name>
    <Path>ExamplePath2</Path>

## Capabilities
- Note: Make sure to add a requirement if your map uses Capabilities from a mod that are not compatible with the base game! Example being anything from Mapping Extensions

| Capability | Mod |
| - | - |
| "Mapping Extensions"| Mapping Extensions |
| "Chroma"| Chroma |
| "Chroma Lighting Events"| Chroma |
| "Chroma Special Events"| Chroma |

## Beatmap Characteristics
- These control what difficulty set the difficulty is placed under, so if you wanted to include a set of 5 difficulties that were all one saber in addition to a normal set of 5 difficulties, similar to what the OST does, you would give all of the one saber difficultyLevels a characteristic of one saber (The SerializedName of a registered Characteristic is what should be put in the map

| Characteristic | Source |
| - | - |
| "360Degree" | Base Game |
| "90Degree" | Base Game |
| "Standard"| Base Game |
| "NoArrows"| Base Game |
| "OneSaber"| Base Game |
| "Lawless"| SongCore |
| "Lightshow"| SongCore |

## Keyboard Shortcuts
*(Make sure Beat Saber's window is in focus when using these shortcuts)*
---
 * Press <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> when in the main menu to do a full refresh. (This means removing deleted songs and updating existing songs)
 * Press <kbd>R</kbd> when in main menu to do a quick refresh (This will only add new songs in the CustomLevels folder)

## For modders
 * Extra data contained in songs that are not part of the base game, e.g. requirements, colors, custom platforms, etc. can be accessed using SongCore
 ```csharp
 //To retrieve the data for a song
 SongCore.Collections.RetrieveExtraSongData(string levelID, string loadIfNullPath = "");
 //This will return the ExtraSongData for the given levelID if it finds it, and if it does not find it, it will attempt
 // To load it using the loadIfNullPath if one is provided, otherwise it will return null

 //You can also use the below function to specifically get the DifficultyData for a song, which contains information such as requirements that difficulty has
   SongCore.Collections.RetrieveDifficultyData(IDifficultyBeatmap beatmap)
  // This will attempt to retrieve the DifficultyData, and return null if it does not find one
 
 //You can also use this function to manually load and add the ExtraSongData for a song by giving it the levelID and path which can be found in the CustomSongInfo for a song
 SongCore.Collections.AddSong(string levelID, string path, bool replace = false)
 // If replace is true it will update an existing ExtraSongData for that song if one is present, otherwise if one already exists it will do nothing
 ```
 * You can add/remove capabilities to your mods for maps to be able to use by doing the following
 ```csharp
 // To register
 SongCore.Collections.RegisterCapability("Capability name");
 // To remove
  SongCore.Collections.DeregisterizeCapability("Capability name");
 
 //If you make a mod that registers a capability feel free to message me on Discord ( Kyle1413#1413 ) and I will add it to the list above
 ```
  * You can register a beatmap characteristic OnApplicationStart by doing the following **Make sure to do this before SongCore loads songs**
 ```csharp
 SongCore.Collections.RegisterCustomCharacteristic(Sprite Icon, "Characteristic Name", "Hint Text", "SerializedName", "CompoundIdPartName");
//For the SerializedName and CompoundIdPartName, as a basic rule can just put the characteristic name without spaces or special characters
//The Characteristic Name will be what mappers put as the characteristic when labelling their difficulties
//If you make a mod that registers a characteristic feel free to message me on Discord ( Kyle1413#1413 ) and I will add it to the list above
 ```
 * You can add a song folder entry for songcore to load songs from by doing the following as early as OnApplicationStart **Make sure to only call this once**. It will return a reference to the SeperateSongFolder it adds that your mod can use to check the levels loaded within the folder entry after SongCore loads songs.
```csharp
SongCore.Collections.AddSeperateSongFolder("Name of the Entry/Levelpack if set to be its own", "Full path to the folder songs will be stored in", Pack(Refer to folders.xml documentation), Sprite Image(Optional, if null defaults to folder icon), bool wip (Optional)  )
```
