# SongCore
A plugin for handling custom song additions in Beat Saber.
## Installing Custom Songs
- Custom Song folders go in `Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels`
- The song files must be in the root of the song folder, and not within a subfolder
- You can place songs in the `Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels` folder instead to place them in the `WIP Maps` song pack and have them only be playable in practice mode. This is recommended if you are either making the map yourself or testing someone else's map
``` 
Required files:
  1. cover.jpg (Size 256x256)
    - This is the picture shown next to song in the selection screen.
    - The name can be whatever you want, make sure its the same as the one found in info.dat
    - Only supported image file formats are JPG and PNG
  2. song.ogg
    - This is your song you would like to load
    - Name must be the same as in info.dat
    - Only supported audio file formats are WAV and OGG
    - Songe Converter and BeatSaver will convert to EGG
  3. easy.dat / normal.dat / hard.dat / expert.dat
    - This is the note chart for each difficulty
    - Names must match the "_beatmapFilename" in info.dat
    - Use a Beat Saber editor to make your own note chart for the song
  4. info.dat
    - Contains the info for the song
```

## Capabilities
- Note: Make sure to add a requirement if your map uses Capabilities from a mod that are not compatible with the base game! Example being anything from Mapping Extensions

| Capability | Mod |
| - | - |
| "Mapping Extensions"| Mapping Extensions |
| "Chroma"| Chroma |
| "Chroma Lighting Events"| Chroma |
| "Chroma Special Events"| Chroma |

## Beatmap Characteristics
- These control what difficulty set the difficulty is placed under, so if you wanted to include a set of 5 difficulties that were all one saber in addition to a normal set of 5 difficulties, similar to what the OST does, you would give all of the one saber difficultyLevels a characteristic of one saber (The SerializedName of a registered Characteristic is what should be put in the map

| Characteristic | Source |
| - | - |
| "Standard"| Base Game |
| "NoArrows"| Base Game |
| "OneSaber"| Base Game |
| "Lawless"| SongCore |
| "Lightshow"| SongCore |

## Keyboard Shortcuts
*(Make sure Beat Saber's window is in focus when using these shortcuts)*
---
 * Press <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> when in the main menu to do a full refresh. (This means removing deleted songs and updating existing songs)
 * Press <kbd>R</kbd> when in main menu to do a quick refresh (This will only add new songs in the CustomLevels folder)

## For modders
 * Extra data contained in songs that are not part of the base game, e.g. requirements, colors, custom platforms, etc. can be accessed using SongCore
 ```csharp
 //To retrieve the data for a song
 SongCore.Collections.RetrieveExtraSongData(string levelID, string loadIfNullPath = "");
 //This will return the ExtraSongData for the given levelID if it finds it, and if it does not find it, it will attempt
 // To load it using the loadIfNullPath if one is provided, otherwise it will return null

 //You can also use the below function to specifically get the DifficultyData for a song, which contains information such as requirements that difficulty has
   SongCore.Collections.RetrieveDifficultyData(IDifficultyBeatmap beatmap)
  // This will attempt to retrieve the DifficultyData, and return null if it does not find one
 
 //You can also use this function to manually load and add the ExtraSongData for a song by giving it the levelID and path which can be found in the CustomSongInfo for a song
 SongCore.Collections.AddSong(string levelID, string path, bool replace = false)
 // If replace is true it will update an existing ExtraSongData for that song if one is present, otherwise if one already exists it will do nothing
 ```
 * You can add/remove capabilities to your mods for maps to be able to use by doing the following
 ```csharp
 // To register
 SongCore.Collections.RegisterCapability("Capability name");
 // To remove
  SongCore.Collections.DeregisterizeCapability("Capability name");
 
 //If you make a mod that registers a capability feel free to message me on Discord ( Kyle1413#1413 ) and I will add it to the list above
 ```
  * You can register a beatmap characteristic OnApplicationStart by doing the following **Make sure to do this before SongCore loads songs**
 ```csharp
 SongCore.Collections.RegisterCustomCharacteristic(Sprite Icon, "Characteristic Name", "Hint Text", "SerializedName", "CompoundIdPartName");
//For the SerializedName and CompoundIdPartName, as a basic rule can just put the characteristic name without spaces or special characters
//The Characteristic Name will be what mappers put as the characteristic when labelling their difficulties
//If you make a mod that registers a characteristic feel free to message me on Discord ( Kyle1413#1413 ) and I will add it to the list above
 ```
